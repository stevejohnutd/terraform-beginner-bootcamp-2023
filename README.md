# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic Versioning ðŸ§™

This project is going to utilize Semantic Versioning for its tagging
[semver.org](https://semver.org/). 


The general format:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.1`
- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Install the Terraform CLI

### Considerations with the Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation instructions have changed due to gpg keyring changes. So the original gitpod.yml bash. So we need to refer to the latest install CLI instructions via Terraform Documentation and change the scripting for install.

### Considerations for Linux Distribution

This project is built against Ubuntu. 
Please consider checkign your Linux Distribution and change accordingly to distribution needs.

Example of checking OS version
```

$ cat /etc/os-release

PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg depreciation issues we noticed that bash scripts were a considerable amount more code. So we created a new Terraform CLI bash script. 

This bash script is located in: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- This will keep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This will allow us an easier way to debug and execute manual Terraform CLI install.
- This will allow better portability for other projects that need to install Terraform CLI.

#### Shebang Considerations
A Shebang (pronounced Sha-bang) tells the bash script what program that will interpret the script. eg. `#!/bin/bash`

ChatGPT recommends this format for bash: `#!usr/bin/env bash`

- for portability for different OS distributions
- will search the user's PATH for the bash executable.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

#### Execution Considerations
When executing the bash script we can use the `./` shorthand notation to execute the bash script.

eg. `./bin/install_terraform_cli`

If we are using a script in .gitpod.yml we need to point the script to a program to interpret it.

eg. `source ./bin/install_terraform_cli`


#### Linux Permissions Considerations
In order to make our bash scripts executable, we need to change Linux permisssion for the fix to be executable at the user mode.

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```
Alternatively:

```sh
chmod 744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

### Github Lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

We need to be careful when using the Init because it will not re-run if we restart an existing workspace.

https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks

### Working with Env Vars

We can list out all Environment Variables (Env Vars) using the `env` command

We can filter specific env vars using grep eg. `env | grep AWS_`

#### Setting and Unsetting Env Vars

In the terminal we can set using `export HELLO='world'`

In the terminal we can unset using `unset HELLO`

We can set an env var temporarily when just runing a command.

```sh
HELLO='world' ./bin/print_message
```
Within a bash script we can set env without writing export eg.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
HELLO='world'

echo $HELLO
```
#### Printing Vars

We can print an env var using echo eg. `echo $HELLO`

#### Scoping of Env Vars

When you open up new bash terminals in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you set in another window.

If you want Env Vars to persist across all future bash terminals that are open you need to set env vars in your bash profile. eg. `.bash_profile`

#### Persisting Env Vars in Gitpod

We can persist env vars into Gitpod by storing them in Gitpod Secrets Storage.

```
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in those workspaces.

You can also set env vars in the `.gitpod.yml` - but shouldn't keep sensitive env vars (ex: password values)
